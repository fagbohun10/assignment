Structure of Linux Filesystem

The Linux filesystem is a hierarchical structure of directories and files. The root directory, /, is the top of the hierarchy. All other directories and files are located below the root directory.

Directories are used to organize files. They can contain other directories, as well as files. Files are the basic unit of storage in the Linux filesystem. They can contain text, data, or executable code.

The Linux filesystem is divided into several main directories, each of which contains a different type of file. These directories are:

/bin: Contains essential system binaries, such as ls, cd, and cp.
/boot: Contains the kernel and other files needed to boot the system.
/dev: Contains device files, which represent physical devices, such as hard drives, keyboards, and mice.
/etc: Contains configuration files for the system.
/home: Contains user home directories.
/lib: Contains shared libraries, which are used by executable files.
/media: Contains removable media, such as USB drives and CD-ROMs.
/mnt: Contains directories for mounting filesystems from other systems.
/opt: Contains third-party software.
/proc: Contains information about the running system.
/root: Contains the root user's home directory.
/sbin: Contains system binaries that only need to be run by root.
/srv: Contains data for servers.
/tmp: Contains temporary files.
/usr: Contains most of the system's files, including applications, libraries, and documentation.
/var: Contains variable data, such as log files and mail spools.

2. With respect to Terraform, what is a provider?


Answer



In Terraform, a provider is a plugin that allows Terraform to interact with a specific infrastructure platform. Providers are responsible for understanding the API of the platform and exposing resources that Terraform can manage.

Each provider defines a set of resource types that Terraform can manage. For example, the AWS provider defines resource types for EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and RDS databases.

When you use Terraform to manage resources, you specify the provider that you want to use. For example, to create an EC2 instance, you would use the aws_instance resource type and specify the aws provider.

Terraform providers are available for a wide range of infrastructure platforms, including:

AWS
Azure
Google Cloud Platform
Kubernetes
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
VMware vSphere
Terraform providers are open source and can be developed by anyone. There are hundreds of providers available, and the number is growing all the time.

Providers are a key part of Terraform's flexibility and extensibility. They allow Terraform to be used to manage a wide range of infrastructure platforms.




3. Describe how Terraform manages state and what is the recommended approach to manage the state file?

Answer

Terraform manages state by storing a record of the resources it has created and their current configuration. This state is used by Terraform to map real world resources to your configuration, keep track of metadata, and to improve performance for large infrastructures.

The state file is typically stored in a local file named terraform.tfstate. However, it can also be stored in a remote location, such as a cloud storage service.

The recommended approach to managing the state file depends on your specific needs. If you are working on a personal project, you can store the state file locally. However, if you are working on a team project, you should store the state file in a remote location, such as a cloud storage service. This will allow multiple team members to access the state file and collaborate on the project.

Here are some additional considerations when managing the state file:

Security: The state file contains sensitive information, such as the names and passwords of your infrastructure resources. You should take steps to secure the state file, such as encrypting it and storing it in a secure location.
Backup: The state file is critical to your infrastructure. You should back it up regularly in case of a disaster.
Version control: You should version control the state file. This will allow you to track changes to the state file and revert to a previous state if necessary.
Here are some of the best practices for managing the state file:

Use a remote backend: A remote backend is a secure and reliable way to store the state file. There are a number of remote backends available, including:
Amazon S3
Google Cloud Storage
Azure Blob Storage
Encrypt the state file: The state file contains sensitive information, such as the names and passwords of your infrastructure resources. You should encrypt the state file to protect this information.
Back up the state file: The state file is critical to your infrastructure. You should back it up regularly in case of a disaster.
Version control the state file: You should version control the state file. This will allow you to track changes to the state file and revert to a previous state if necessary.

## System Architecture and Application Design, Cloud Computing (AWS)

1. You have configured your AWSCLI command line tool with the keys of a user you have created in your AWS account. Upon running the AWSCLI it complains of a permissions problem. What would you do to fix the problem?

2. AWS has data centres aggregated in places called regions. Name three regions closest to your home.

3. Describe how the AWS root account is different from ordinary IAM user and what is the recommended approach to handle the details of the AWS root account?
What are the AWS access key and secret access key used for?


Answer


1. If you have configured your AWSCLI command line tool with the keys of a user you have created in your AWS account and upon running the AWSCLI it complains of a permissions problem, you can try the following to fix the problem:

Make sure that you are using the correct access key and secret access key.
Make sure that you are using the correct region.
Make sure that you have the correct permissions for the actions you are trying to perform.
If you are still having problems, you can contact AWS support for help.

2. AWS has data centers aggregated in places called regions. Regions are identified by a two-letter code, such as us-east-1 or eu-west-1. The regions closest to my home are:

us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
us-west-2 (Oregon)
eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)

3. The AWS root account is the original account that is created when you sign up for AWS. The root account has full access to all of your AWS resources. An ordinary IAM user is a user that you create in your AWS account. IAM users can be given specific permissions to access your AWS resources.

The recommended approach to handle the details of the AWS root account is to create a strong password and store it in a secure location. You should also enable two-factor authentication for the root account.

The AWS access key and secret access key are used to authenticate to AWS services. The access key is a unique identifier for your account. The secret access key is a password that is used to encrypt the access key. You should never share your access key and secret access key with anyone.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.




## Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), Troubleshooting, Observability

1. To what extend do you use public resources such as Google and Youtube to aid in your problem resolution endeavour?

2. What would be your attitude if your manager asked you to use Google to investigate a critical issue in your infrastructure?

I use public resources such as Google and Youtube to a great extent to aid in my problem resolution endeavors. I find that these resources can be a valuable source of information and help me to quickly find solutions to problems. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to use these resources, and I am always open to suggestions from others.

If my manager asked me to use Google to investigate a critical issue in my infrastructure, I would be happy to do so. I believe that it is important to use all available resources to resolve problems as quickly as possible. I would start by searching for information on Google that is specific to the issue I am facing. I would also look for videos on Youtube that demonstrate how to resolve the issue. Once I have gathered some information, I would then work with my manager to develop a plan to resolve the issue.

I believe that it is important to be proactive in problem resolution. By using public resources such as Google and Youtube, I can quickly find solutions to problems and help to keep my infrastructure running smoothly.

Here are some additional tips for using public resources to aid in problem resolution:

Be specific in your search terms. The more specific you are, the more likely you are to find relevant information.

Use multiple search engines. Not all search engines are created equal. Some are better at finding certain types of information than others.

Use filters. Many search engines allow you to filter your results by date, relevance, and other criteria. This can help you to narrow down your search and find the information you need more quickly.

Read the comments. Often, the comments section below a search result can provide valuable insights and additional information.

Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you're stuck, don't be afraid to ask for help from a colleague or mentor. They may be able to point you in the right direction or provide you with the information you need.
