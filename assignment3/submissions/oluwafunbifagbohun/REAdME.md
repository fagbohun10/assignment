## Kubernetes, Docker, Containerisation and Virtualisation
What is a hypervisor and where does it sit in the server virtualisation stack?

Answer

A hypervisor, also known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM), is a software or firmware component that enables server virtualization. It allows multiple virtual machines (VMs) to run on a single physical server by abstracting and managing the underlying hardware resources.

The hypervisor sits at the lowest level of the server virtualization stack, directly above the physical hardware. It interacts with the server's hardware, including the CPU, memory, storage, and network interfaces, and provides a layer of virtualization that allows the creation and management of virtual machines.

There are two main types of hypervisors:

Type 1 or Bare-Metal Hypervisors: These hypervisors run directly on the physical hardware without the need for an underlying operating system. They have direct access to the hardware resources, providing high performance and efficiency. Examples of type 1 hypervisors include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Citrix XenServer.

Type 2 or Hosted Hypervisors: These hypervisors run on top of a host operating system. The host operating system manages the hardware resources and provides services to the hypervisor and virtual machines. Type 2 hypervisors are typically used in desktop or workstation virtualization scenarios. Examples of type 2 hypervisors include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Microsoft Virtual PC.

The hypervisor allows the creation, provisioning, and management of virtual machines. It allocates hardware resources to each VM, isolates them from one another, and ensures their smooth operation. The hypervisor also facilitates features such as virtual machine migration, snapshotting, and resource allocation.

Above the hypervisor layer, there are additional software components that form the server virtualization stack, such as management software, virtualization APIs, orchestration tools, and application software running within the virtual machines. These components work together to provide a complete virtualization solution.


What is a container runtime and name the two most common runtimes?
Linux administration and shell scripting

Answer


A container runtime is a software component that creates and runs containers. It is responsible for loading container images from a repository, monitoring local system resources, isolating system resources for use of a container, and managing container lifecycle.

The two most common container runtimes are:

Docker: Docker is a popular container runtime that is easy to use and has a large community of users.
Kubernetes: Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that can manage multiple container runtimes.
Other popular container runtimes include:

CRI-O: CRI-O is a lightweight container runtime that is designed to be integrated with Kubernetes.
Podman: Podman is a container runtime that is similar to Docker, but it is not tied to any specific container image format.
runC: runC is a lightweight container runtime that is designed to be used as a building block for other container runtimes.
Container runtimes are an important part of the container ecosystem. They provide the foundation for running containers and managing container lifecycle.

Here are some additional details about the two most common container runtimes:

Docker

Docker is a popular container runtime that is easy to use and has a large community of users. Docker provides a number of features that make it easy to create, run, and manage containers, including:

A simple command-line interface for creating and managing containers
A registry for storing and sharing container images
A Dockerfile format for defining container images
Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a container orchestration system that can manage multiple container runtimes. Kubernetes provides a number of features that make it easy to scale and manage containerized applications, including:

A scheduler for automatically assigning containers to hosts
A load balancer for distributing traffic to containers
A health checker for monitoring container health
Kubernetes is a complex system, but it can provide a number of benefits for organizations that are running containerized applications.

## Linux administration and shell scripting

Use just one command to create a directory structure where the directory sports contains a directory called footballteams which itself contains africanteam which itself contains pwdkumba.


Answer

here is the command to create the directory structure:

Code snippet

mkdir -p sports/footballteams/africanteam/pwdkumba

The -p flag tells the mkdir command to create all parent directories that do not exist. So, in this case, the mkdir command will create the sports directory, the footballteams directory, and the africanteam directory, if they do not already exist. Then, it will create the pwdkumba directory inside the africanteam directory.

Here is a breakdown of the command: 

mkdir: This is the command to create a directory.
-p: This flag tells the mkdir command to create all parent directories that do not exist.
sports/footballteams/africanteam/pwdkumba: This is the path to the directory that you want to create.


Use the tree command to display your directory structure.

Answer

.
├── bin
│   ├── tree
│   └── pwdkumba
└── sports
    └── footballteams
        └── africanteam
            └── pwdkumba


Research the following linux commands a) grep b) sed c) awk


 here are some details about the Linux commands grep, sed, and awk:

Grep

Grep is a command-line utility used to search for text patterns in files. It is one of the most commonly used Linux commands. Grep can be used to search for a specific string of text, or it can be used to search for a pattern that matches a regular expression.

The basic syntax for grep is:

Code snippet
grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE]
Use code with caution. Learn more
The PATTERN argument is the text or regular expression that you want to search for. The FILE argument is the file that you want to search. If the FILE argument is not specified, grep will search the standard input.

Here are some examples of how to use grep:

Code snippet
grep "hello" file.txt
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will search the file file.txt for the string "hello".

Code snippet
grep -E "hello|world" file.txt
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will search the file file.txt for the strings "hello" or "world".

Code snippet
grep -i "hello" file.txt
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will search the file file.txt for the string "hello", ignoring case.

Sed

Sed is a command-line utility used to edit text files. It can be used to search for and replace text, as well as to perform other text transformations.

The basic syntax for sed is:

Code snippet
sed [OPTIONS] SCRIPT [FILE]
Use code with caution. Learn more
The SCRIPT argument is a sequence of sed commands. The FILE argument is the file that you want to edit. If the FILE argument is not specified, sed will edit the standard input.

Here are some examples of how to use sed:

Code snippet
sed 's/hello/world/' file.txt
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will replace all occurrences of the string "hello" with the string "world" in the file file.txt.

Code snippet
sed -i 's/hello/world/' file.txt
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will replace all occurrences of the string "hello" with the string "world" in the file file.txt and save the changes to the file.

Code snippet
sed '/hello/d' file.txt
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will delete all lines in the file file.txt that contain the string "hello".

Awk

Awk is a programming language that can be used to process text files. It is similar to sed, but it is more powerful and flexible.

The basic syntax for awk is:

Code snippet
awk [OPTIONS] SCRIPT [FILE]
Use code with caution. Learn more
The SCRIPT argument is a sequence of awk commands. The FILE argument is the file that you want to process. If the FILE argument is not specified, awk will process the standard input.

Here are some examples of how to use awk:

Code snippet
awk '{print $1}' file.txt
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will print the first column of the file file.txt.

Code snippet
awk '{sum += $1} END {print sum}' file.txt
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will print the sum of all the numbers in the file file.txt.

Code snippet
awk -F, '{print $1, $2}' file.txt
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will print the first and second columns of the file file.txt, separated by a comma.

2. You have a workflow running on GitHub Action that has the following code;
```
jobs:
  deploy_to_production:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: deploy to production with soruce code
    steps:
      - name: Checkout GitHub Action
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Login via Azure CLI
        uses: azure/login@v1
        with:
          creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

      - name: deploy to production step with soruce code
        uses: azure/spring-cloud-deploy@v1
        with:
          azure-subscription: ${{ env.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION }}
          action: deploy
          service-name: <service instance name>
          app-name: <app name>
          use-staging-deployment: false
          package: ${{ env.ASC_PACKAGE_PATH }}
```
Describe what you think this code is doing.



Answer


To check the remote address of a cloned repository on your laptop, you can use the git remote -v command. This will show you a list of all the remotes, along with their URLs. For example, if you have cloned the myfirstrepo repository, and you have added a remote called origin, the output of the git remote -v command would look like this:
Code snippet
origin https://github.com/fagbohun10/myfirstrepo.git (fetch)
origin https://github.com/fagbohun10/myfirstrepo.git (push)
Use code with caution. Learn more
To change the remote address of a cloned repository, you can use the git remote set-url command. For example, if you want to change the remote address of the origin remote to point to the mysecondrepo repository, you would use the following command:

Code snippet
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/fagbohun10/mysecondrepo.git
